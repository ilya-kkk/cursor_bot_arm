# Cursor Rules for rockchip

## Code changes Workflow
- Always after every code change, you must run the following commands:
  ```bash
  git add . && git commit -m '<NAME>' && git push 
- Replace <NAME> with a short description of the bug fix or feature added in this commit in english language

## Rules for changing the Project:
- Always start by running the project.  
  - Always run commands on the CM5 via SSH.
  - Always execute code inside a **Docker Compose** environment.
- If an error occurs:
  - Search online for solutions.  
  - Use firecrawl-mcp to browse websites.  
  - Use context7-mcp to read documentation.  
  - Try different solutions step by step until the issue is resolved.  

- Always after **each attempt to run the project**, send me a report on Telegram.  
  - The report must be written **in Russian**.  
  - The format of the report should be:

    ```
    Встретил ошибку: <ERROR_NAME>
    Попробовал 1: не получилось
    Попробовал 2: не получилось
    ...
    Попробовал N: получилось
    ```

  - If you find a workaround instead of a direct solution, include it in the report.
